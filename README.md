# Credit_EDA

## <h1><b1>Overview</b1></h1>

This repository contains the code and analysis for conducting credit risk assessment using exploratory data analysis (EDA), multivariate analysis techniques, prior application analysis, and merging results for informed decision-making.

Features

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilize descriptive statistics, visualization techniques, and data preprocessing to gain insights into the dataset.

**Multivariate Analysis**: Employ advanced statistical techniques to explore relationships between multiple variables and identify patterns in the data.

**Prior Application Analysis**: Analyze historical credit applications to identify trends, common characteristics, and factors influencing credit decisions.

**Merged Results for Decisions**: Integrate findings from EDA, multivariate analysis, and prior application analysis to make informed decisions regarding credit risk assessment.
